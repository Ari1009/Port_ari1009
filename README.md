# Portfolio-Website

So basically this is a pixel themed website, an art style which i truly adore and various indie game inspired me to build  a website based on these theme✌️.

The process was kinda fresh and new, had to learn a lot of new stuffs.

- Using component from Reactjs
- Managing applcation state with Redux
- Animations from Framer motion library

## The States

There are 2  reducers 

1. dataReducer.tsx- to control app state
1. envReducer.tsx- to control background,player etc, basically anything related to visualeffects

## The Challanges

The difficult part would be making the page responive and phone view.

## Animations

Mostly controlled by the framer-motion library except the environment animations which are coded with css keyframes.

Environment is randomised on every page load. There are currently 3 types:

- cyber
- downtown
- forest
